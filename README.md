## Purpose

There are a vast amount of learning resources available for learning a new language. In particular, there are a vast number of reading materials. H

One effective way to improve one's ability in a language is through raw exposure to it which expands the learner's lexicon, and introduces simple phrases
which aren't immediately available from rote translation.

Currently, the main way to gain exposure is through reading materials like books, news articles, or other media. These have the following problems though:
1. Without stopping and taking note of words that were not understood, it creates no record of new vocabulary items to be reviewed.
2. Revisitation and reassessment of comprehension generally is not pursued (people do not revisit the article daily).

The aim of this program is to continuously test and score a user by employing a corpus of words and phrases ranked based on their frequency. The user is presented
with a phrase containing a key word for the purpose of translation. For example:

"Le garçon mange une pomme."
"La fille parle avec le garçon."
"Le garçon cherchait la clé perdue."

With each of these phrases, the user's answer quality is ranked and compared. If the user is able to translate a large number of phrases concerning *un garçon*, then phrases with the
word will be downranked in favor of more complex words or phrases.
